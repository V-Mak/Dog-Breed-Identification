# Dog-Breed-Identification


`Objective`:
Build a machine learning model to identify the breed of a dog from an image.

`Data`:
*A dataset containing over 10,000 images of dogs from 120 different breeds.*
*Each image is labeled with the breed of the dog in the image.*

`Evaluation`:
*The model will be evaluated on its ability to correctly identify the breed of a dog in a new image.*
*The metric for evaluation is accuracy.*

`Rules`:
*Participants are allowed to use any machine learning algorithm or pre-trained model.*
*Participants must submit their model trained on the provided training data.*
*Participants are not allowed to use any external data or knowledge to train their model.*

`Evaluation`:
*The winning model will be the model that achieves the highest accuracy on the test dataset.*

`Submission Guidelines`:
*Participants must submit their model as a prediction file containing the predicted breed for each image in the test dataset.*

`Additional Notes`:
*The dataset is available for download on the Kaggle website.*
*The competition website contains a leaderboard that tracks the performance of the top models.*
*There is also a discussion forum where participants can ask questions and share ideas.*
